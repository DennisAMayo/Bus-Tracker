# Bus Tracker

This is an interactive code that allows you to see the stops between MIT and Harvard.  The map is provided by mapbox with an api key.  In future updates I want to add the the times at which the bus stops at each bus stop.  Also add the bus current position based off time of date and whats the next stop.

## How to Run
Open up the <a href="https://dennisamayo.github.io/Bus-Tracker/">Bus-Tracker</a> and click on the red button on the top left that says "Show stops between MIT and Harvard".

## Future Releases

- Add multiple buses and direction of travel.
- Display times for each stop.
